# ML-For-Market-Segmentation
## Project Overview
In this project, you have been hired as a data scientist at a bank and you have been provided with extensive data on the bank's customers for the past 6 months. Data includes transactions frequency, amount, tenure..etc. The bank marketing team would like to leverage AI/ML to launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to specific group of customers. In order for this campaign to be successful, the bank has to divide its customers into at least 3 distinctive groups. This process is known as "marketing segmentation" and it crucial for maximizing marketing campaign conversion rate.
